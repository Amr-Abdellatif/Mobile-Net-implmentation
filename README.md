# MobileNet Fun

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the code universe, where MobileNet meets PyTorch! ðŸš€

## What's This?

This is my take on the MobileNet architecture, but with a sprinkle of fun! I decided to dive into PyTorch and create this project just for the joy of coding and exploration. It's not your usual MobileNet implementation; it's MobileNet with a twist!

## Why MobileNet?

Well, why not? MobileNet is a nifty little architecture designed for efficiency, and I thought, "Hey, let's put a playful spin on it!" So, here it is â€“ my coding playground where MobileNet gets a touch of creativity.
